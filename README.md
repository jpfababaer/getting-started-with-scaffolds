Using Scaffolds:

10 When using the generator "Scaffolds" it takes into account all the boilerplate and RESTful APIs that is expected of web developers. Therefore, running a command like:

rails generate scaffold book title:string description:text released:boolean

will do the same effects as draft:resource AND THEN SOME. SEARCH routes.rb for the new routes THEN go to routes.rb
